;; ### Overview
;; The public API for Kibit is through the `check-*` functions below.
;;
;;  * `check-expr` - for checking single expressions (great on the REPL)
;;  * `check-reader` - for checking all forms passed in via a `PushbackReader`
;;  * `check-file` - for checking any file, or string/URI/URL for a file
;;
;; All other functions in this namespace exist to provide support and ease
;; of use for integrated Kibit into other technologies.

;; The rule sets
;; -------------
;;
;; Rule sets are stored in individual files that have a top level
;; `(defrules rules ...)`. The collection of rules are in the `rules`
;; directory.
;;
;; Here, we logically prepare all the rules, by substituting in logic vars
;; where necessary.
;;
;; For more information, see: [rules](#kibit.rules) namespace
(def all-rules (map logic/prep core-rules/all-rules))

;; Reading source files
;; --------------------
;; ### Extracting forms

;; `read-file` is intended to be used with a Clojure source file,
;; read in by Clojure's LineNumberingPushbackReader *(LNPR)*. Expressions are
;; extracted using the clojure reader (ala `read`), and line numbers
;; are added as `:line` metadata to the forms (via LNPR).

(defn- careful-refer
  "Refers into the provided namespace all public vars from clojure.core
except for those that would clobber any existing interned vars in that
namespace.  This is needed to ensure that symbols read within syntax-quote
end up being fully-qualified to clojure.core as appropriate, and only
to *ns* if they're not available there.  AFAICT, this will work for all
symbols in syntax-quote except for those referring to vars that are referred
into the namespace."

    (do-read (careful-refer (create-ns init-ns)))))

;; ### Analyzing the pieces

;; `tree-seq` returns a lazy-seq of nodes for a tree.
;; Given an expression, we can then match rules against its pieces.
;; This is like using `clojure.walk` with `identity`:
;;
;;     user=> (expr-seq '(if (pred? x) (inc x) x))
;;     ((if (pred? x) (inc x) x)
;;      if
;;      (pred? x)
;;      pred?
;;      x
;;      (inc x)
;;      inc
;;      x
;;      x)`
;;
;; This is needed for `:subform` reporting.
(defn expr-seq
  "Given an expression (any piece of Clojure data), return a lazy (depth-first)
  sequence of the expr and all its sub-expressions"
  [expr]
  (tree-seq sequential?
            seq

;; Building results / `simplify-maps`
;; -----------------------------------

;; See the [core](#kibit-core) namespace for details on simplifying an expression.

;; ### Guarding the check

;; Guarding `check-*` allows for fine-grained control over what
;; gets passed to a reporter.  This allows those using kibit
;; as a library or building out tool/IDE integration to shape
;; the results prior to reporting.
;;
;; Normally, you'll only want to report an alternative form if it differs
;; from the original expression form.  You can use `identity` to short circuit
;; the guard and ALWAYS receive the `simlify-map`.
;;
;; Check-guards take a map and return a map or nil

  alternative is different than the original expresion"

   :guard      unique-alt?
   :resolution :subform
   :init-ns    'user})

;; ### Resolution
;; Kibit can report at various levels of resolution.
;;
;; `:toplevel` will simplify a toplevel form, like `(defn ...)`
;; and all of the subforms it contains. This is exceptionally useful if
;; you're looking for paragraph-sized suggestions, or you're using
;; Kibit on the REPL (per expression).
;;
;; `:subform` will only report on the subforms. This is most common
;; for standard reporting, and what gets used when Kibit's Leinigen
;; plugin is `:verbose false`, the default setting.

;; Map the levels of resolution to the correct combination of `simplify`
;; and `read-seq` functions.

   :subform  (fn [reader init-ns]
               (mapcat expr-seq (read-file (LineNumberingPushbackReader. reader) init-ns)))})

;; Checking the expressions
;; ------------------------
;;
;; All of the `check-*` functions take an expression and the same
;; core keyword arguments.  They use the most common arguments by default
;; and all return a sequence of `simplify-maps` that pass the check-guard.
;;
;; You can pass in your own `:rules` set, check `:guard`, and toggle
;; the `:resolution` to achieve your desired output map sequence.
;;
;; Here are two examples:
;;
;;     (check-expr '(if true :a :b))
;;     (check-expr '(if true :a :b)
;;       :rules      other-rules
;;       :guard      identity
;;       :resolution :subform)

;; `check-aux` is the heart of all the check related functions.
;; The threading expression can be visualized like this `let` block
;; (formatted for space)
