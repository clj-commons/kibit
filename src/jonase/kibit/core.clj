;; ### Important notes
;; Feel free to contribute rules to [kibit's github repo](https://github.com/jonase/kibit)

;; The rule sets
;; -------------
;;
;; Rule sets are stored in individual files that have a top level
;; `(defrules rules ...)`. The collection of rules are in the `rules`
;; directory.
;;
;; Here, we logically prepare all the rules, by substituting in logic vars
;; where necessary.
;;
;; For more information, see: [rules](#jonase.kibit.rules) namespace

;; Guarding `simplify` allows for fine-grained control over what
;; gets passed to a reporter.  This allows those using kibit
;; as a library or building out tool compatibility to shape
;; the results prior to reporting.
;;

;; from the original expression form.  You can use `identity` to short circuit
;; the guard.

;;
;; We build the simplify-map at the end because
;; Clojure 1.3 munges the metadata in transients (so also in clojure.walk).

;; Reading source files
;; --------------------

;; `read-file` is intended to be used with a  Clojure source file,
